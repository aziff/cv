\section{The Effectiveness and Efficiency of Place-Specific Investment}


\begin{enumerate}
\item Job Market Paper: \textit{Beyond the Local Impacts of Place-Based Policies: Spillovers through Latent Housing Markets}.
\end{enumerate}

It is common to study the direct effectiveness of place-based policies, which target geographic areas often to foster economic development. I propose an approach to study the indirect impacts due to responses of households and firms that propagate within similar markets (e.g., housing markets). To determine latent market structure, I apply a network theory method to data on household movement. I illustrate the approach and discuss the economic framework using a widespread, place-based policy, Tax Increment Financing (TIF). With the data-driven characterization, I estimate the ``market'' spillover effects to non-targeted areas within the same housing market. 

For example, TIF can provide a subsidy for retail development of a large vacant lot. The property values of residential properties immediately surrounding the retail development may increase in response to the development. Because these properties are targeted, I consider this to be a direct treatment effect. In addition, there may be a (smaller) positive effect on non-targeted properties that are close to the development. This is the spatial spillover effect. However, the retail development may affect areas within the same housing markets as the targeted areas. Housing markets may not be contiguous due to housing supply, location of amenities, segregation patterns, or other context-specific factors that determine housing markets. If the subsidy relocates investment away from areas within the same housing markets, the values of those non-targeted properties may decrease. This is an example of the market spillover effect that my approach studies and it explains how it can be negative alongside a locally effective policy.

This example is consistent with my empirical findings, which indicate that TIF is locally effective at increasing property values within the targeted area. However, using my approach, I estimate that the market spillover effects on non-targeted areas within the same housing markets are negative. This implies that the policy relocates investment that otherwise would have occurred elsewhere. I analyze outcomes related to household and firm characteristics and find support for the relocation mechanism. 

I combine the direct and spillover effects to calculate a back-of-the-envelope estimate of an overall effect that is close to zero. With caveats, this result suggests that the policy has a low overall effectiveness from the perspective of a central regional government. I compare the characteristics targeted areas to those of the non-targeted areas in the same housing markets. The targeted areas are relatively disadvantaged suggesting some degree of redistribution within housing markets. These results suggest that TIF is costly from the perspective of the central planner despite achieving moderate redistribution within housing markets that already share many observed and unobserved characteristics. \textbf{This is a working paper.}

% We study how the take-up of flood insurance changes after the construction of a levee. Both flood insurance and a levee are publicly funded and it is of interest how these two interventions detract from or reinforce each other, given households' behavioral responses. In addition to observing construction dates, we incorporate novel data on accreditation dates, after which properties protected by accredited levees experience a reduction in the price of flood insurance. 

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item[5.] We plan to submit the core of this paper, including a description of the data collection of accreditation dates, the empirical estimates on insurance take-up, and a hedonic model, to measure the willingness to pay for flood protection in the presence of heavily subsidized flood insurance.
% \end{enumerate}

% There are two projects that relate to the policy context of levees and flood insurance that continue to interrogate how households respond to the incentives and disincentives tied to living in flood-prone areas. For both of these projects, as well as for future projects in this research agenda, we plan to work to expand the available data on levee construction and accreditation. The data collection we undertook already allow us to observe the accreditation dates of some levees. We aim to expand this further to better study the complex policy environment and economic responses of flooding. 

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item[6.] \textit{Enforcement of Flood Insurance Mandates}. Federal law requires that households in flood-prone areas purchase flood insurance. However, the take-up of flood insurance varies widely across the U.S. One challenge in studying this uneven take-up is measuring the enforcement of the mandate, which generally falls on mortgage lenders and the Federal Reserve. We plan to explore different variation determining flood insurance take-up including lender heterogeneity and variation in mandate regulation policies. 

% \item[7.] \textit{Household Information on Levees and Flood Insurance}. Our empirical results highlight the counter-intuitive finding that households reduce flood insurance take-up after a levee's accreditation lowers the cost of flood insurance. It is possible that households underestimate the risk of flooding, which the levee does not completely eradicate. We plan to pursue funding and partnership with government agencies to implement an experiment. We hope to randomly disseminate information about levee protectiveness and local insurance requirements. Treatment effects on changes in the uptake of flood insurance would reveal to what degree incorrect information determines households' risky flood insurance choices.

\section{The Importance of Place for Household Outcomes}


The first stream of my research agenda relates to economic framework and econometric approaches to consider the consequences of place-based interventions; place can also play a role in economic outcomes even without a specific intervention tied to it. The second stream of my research agenda relates to these circumstances.

\begin{enumerate}

\item[3.] \textit{Rental Choice Sets in Low- and High-Opportunity Neighborhoods for Housing Choice Voucher Program Participants}. Participants in the Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCVP) face constraints in location choice both due to constrained resources and additional policy requirements of the program. A challenge to understand these constraints is the measurement of the choice sets. In \citet{park_rental_2023}, we combine restricted-access data from the U.S.\ Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) with a novel data source on advertised rental prices to observe the weekly choice sets of HCVP participants, and describe them by geographic location and household demographics. Observing the choice sets expands modeling possibilities in a structural framework of residential sorting. \textbf{This project is in progress.}


\item[4.] \textit{Association between the Volatility of Income and Life Expectancy in the U.S.} In \citet{ziff_association_2023}, we study the relationship between household income volatility and life expectancy using a household-level consumer dataset. We find that income is an important mediator of the correlation, with the bottom half of the income distribution experiencing negative correlation between income volatility and life expectancy, including if the income volatility is positive. The role of place is notable both in the geographic distribution of households in the bottom half of the income distribution and the possibility that place-specific factors, such as factory closings, contribute to this correlation. \textbf{This paper is Revise and Resubmit at the \textit{Journal of Labor Economics}.}
