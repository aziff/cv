Using a dynamic latent factor structure, we show how measurement restrictions on observed measures aid the identification of skill technology features. We then use our identification results to develop and estimate the joint dynamic process of latent investment and skill development, allowing for static and dynamic complementarities in skill production between parental investments and children's skills. Using data for the United States, we estimate that parental investments are particularly productive in producing cognitive skills during early childhood (ages 5-6). Moreover, we find that the marginal productivity of investments in this period is substantially higher for children with lower existing skills, suggesting the optimal targeting of interventions to disadvantaged young children.},

We describe our framework in three steps. First, we discuss the construction of the survey instrument we used to elicit maternal subjective beliefs. Second, we show how to convert the answers to the survey instrument into estimates of maternal subjective beliefs. Finally, we correlate maternal subjective beliefs with maternal investments of child development. We apply our framework to a unique dataset collected as part of an 18-month-long parenting stimulation program in Colombia, whose target population were low-income households with children aged 12 to 24 months at baseline and lasted 18 months. In this program, home visitors paid weekly visits to randomly chosen households to improve mother-child interactions and other maternal behaviors that foster the development of children's cognitive and non-cognitive skills. We show that the vast majority of mothers believe that the technology of skill formation follows a Cobb-Douglas parameterization, but there is significant heterogeneity in coefficients of investments across mothers. In particular, mothers hold low subjective expectations, which means that mothers underestimate the returns to their investments. We also find that maternal subjective beliefs predict investments, but that the program did not affect maternal subjective beliefs.},

  abstract = {Cities use tax increment financing (TIF) to trigger growth in blighted communities. Critics argue that Chicago's broad conceptualization of ``blight'' facilitates the designation of TIF districts that do not resemble conventional notions of blight, bolstering their natural ability to generate capital, thereby exacerbating the gap between wealthy and poor minority spaces. This study examines Chicago's TIF districts to determine whether blight levels and percentage of non-White residents interact to reduce the effectiveness of TIFs measured as the change in the equalized assessed valuation (EAV) of properties. Using composite indices to measure physical and economic blight, the results of a quantile regression analysis indicate that economically blighted TIFs with predominantly non-White populations outperform other districts. These findings run counter to expectations given that TIFs report high rates of growth in property values, yet they remain substantially blighted. This suggests a need to reconsider change in equalized assessed valuation as the measure of TIF effectiveness given that the ``growth'' in TIFs does not seem to reflect a higher quality of life for residents.},

  abstract = {This paper identifies a new factor, the age of the housing stock, that affects where high- and low-income neighborhoods are located in U.S. cities. High-income households, driven by a high demand for housing services, tend to locate in areas of the city where the housing stock is relatively young. Because cities develop and redevelop from the center outward over time, the location of these neighborhoods varies over the city's history. The model predicts a suburban location for the rich in an initial period, when young dwellings are found only in the suburbs, while predicting eventual gentrification once central redevelopment creates a young downtown housing stock. Controlling for other determinants of where the poor live (e.g., proximity to amenities and public transit), empirical work indicates that if the influence of spatial variation in dwelling ages were eliminated, central-city/suburban disparities in neighborhood economic status would be reduced by up to 10 percentage points. Model estimates further predict that between 2000 and 2020, central-city/ suburban differences in economic status will narrow in cities of all sizes, and especially in the larger metropolitan areas as American cities become more gentrified.},

In addition to finding that TIF districts, on average, are located in areas that are more economically disadvantaged than the municipality as a whole, the results of this study suggest a positive relationship between blight and subsequent property value growth. The results also show that the spatial size of a TIF district has a positive influence on property value growth and that industrial TIF districts and TIF districts located in low-density areas and in areas with high proportions of White residents and close to the city center have higher growth.},

This article addresses the claim by examining the impact of TIF adoption on municipal employment growth in Illinois, looking for both general impact and impact specific to the type of development supported. Results find no general impact of TIF use on employment. However, findings suggest that TIF districts supporting industrial development may have a positive effect on municipal employment, whereas TIF districts supporting retail development have a negative effect on municipal employment. These results are consistent with industrial TIF districts capturing employment that would have otherwise occurred outside of the adopting municipality and retail TIF districts shifting employment within the municipality to more labor-efficient retailers within the TIF district.},

  abstract = {Few empirical strategies have been developed that investigate public provision under majority rule while taking explicit account of the constraints implied by mobility of households. The goal of this paper is to improve our understanding of voting in local communities when neighborhood quality depends on peer or neighborhood effects. We develop a new empirical approach which allows us to impose all restrictions that arise from locational equilibrium models with myopic voting simultaneously on the data generating process. We can then analyze how close myopic models come in replicating the main regularities about expenditures, taxes, sorting by income and housing observed in the data. We find that a myopic voting model that incorporates peer effects fits all dimensions of the data reasonably well.},

Using parcel-level data from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, from 1980 to1999, a semilog econometric model is estimated using fixed effects regression. A two-stage estimation process is also used to test and correct for potential self-selection bias and endogeneity associated with TIF implementation. The findings suggest that the provision of public services offered within TIF districts is capitalized into business property value over time. The magnitude of this effect is the largest of all factors considered. The analysis also reveals that self-selection bias is likely associated with TIF implementation. The endogenously determined probability that a property will be placed within a TIF district is positively correlated with the property's value. Finally, the analysis reveals that the impact of TIF might be underestimated in the absence of corrections for self-selection bias and endogeneity.},

We have constructed an extensive data set for the Chicago metropolitan area that includes information on property value growth before and after TIF adoption. In contrast to the conventional wisdom, we find evidence that cities that adopt TIF grow more slowly than those that do not. We test for and reject sample selection bias as an explanation of this finding.

The evidence for 1999 indicates that communities are most likely to offer one or more of these business development incentives if their residents have low incomes, if they are located close to state borders, and if their states have troubled political cultures. Ten percent greater median household income is associated with a 3.2\% lower probability of offering incentives; 10\% greater distance from a state border is associated with a 1.0\% lower probability of offering incentives; and a 10\% higher rate at which government officials are convicted of federal corruption crimes is associated with a 1.2\% greater probability of offering business incentives. TIFs are the preferred incentive of communities whose residents have household incomes between \$25,000 and \$75,000; whereas TIFs are much less commonly offered by communities whose residents have household incomes below \$25,000. The need to finance TIFs out of incremental tax revenues may make it infeasible for many of the poorest of communities to use TIFs for local business development.},

Job losses attributable to TIF totalled 110 jobs per square mile, and the negative employment effects were sustained over the long term between 2001 and 2011. In contrast, there is some evidence that TIF districts have contributed positively to residential development, although the increase in housing near the districts was not found to be statistically significant in the quasi-experimental integrated lagged adjustment model.},

The last comprehensive review of taxes and economic development, however, was Wasylenko's review in 1997, which mostly examined the location response of firms. Subsequent to the last major review of the literature, empirical work in this area sought to address endogeneity concerns that plagued previous studies, resulting in a series of compelling new studies. This article reviews the empirical literature on tax-based economic development incentives produced since Wasylenko's 1997 review and covers property tax (including tax increment financing and business improvement districts); spatially targeted and zone-based tax concessions; firm-specific incentives; and corporate income taxes. The review focuses on academic studies that employ modern program evaluation or quasi-experimental techniques and U.S.-based policies.},

  abstract = {Most countries exhibit large and persistent geographical differences in wages, income, and unemployment rates. A growing class of placebased policies attempts to address these differences through public investments and subsidies that target disadvantaged neighborhoods, cities, or regions. Place-based policies have the potential to profoundly affect the location of economic activity, along with the wages, employment, and industry mix of communities. These programs are widespread in the United States and throughout the world but have only recently been studied closely by economists. We consider the following questions: Who benefits from place-based interventions? Do the national benefits outweigh the costs? What sorts of interventions are most likely to be effective? To study these questions, we develop a simple spatial equilibrium model designed to characterize the welfare effects of place-based policies on the local and the national economy. Using this model, we critically evaluate the economic rationales for place-based policies and assess the latest evidence on their effects. We conclude with some lessons for policy and directions for future research.},

This paper conducts a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of Chicago's TIF programme in creating economic opportunities and catalysing real estate investments at the neighbourhood scale. This paper uses a unique panel dataset at the block-group level to analyse the impact of TIF designation and investments on employment change, business creation and building permit activity. After controlling for potential selection bias in TIF assignment, this paper shows that TIF ultimately fails the `but-for' test and shows no evidence of increasing tangible economic development benefits for local residents.

Despite the large number of state initiatives and TIF's increasing popularity, few statistical studies have been con ducted to examine the direct effect of the TIF program from an economic perspective. This article analyzes the effect of TIF plans on property value growth by comparing pre-TIF to post-TIF property value changes in a first-difference model. The empiri cal results from a panel of Indiana cities indicate that the TIF program has increased median owner-occupied housing values in a TIF-adopting city by 11\% relative to what it would have been without TIF. This finding suggests that the TIF program effectively stimulates property value growth in an entire community.},

  abstract = {Transactions bias arises when properties that trade are not a random sample of the total housing stock. Price indices are susceptible because they are typically based on transactions data. Existing approaches to this problem rely on Heckman-type correction methods, where a probit regression is used to capture the differences between properties that sell and those that do not sell in a given period. However, this approach can only be applied where there is reliable data on the whole housing stock. In many countries\textemdash the UK included\textemdash no such data exist and there is little prospect of correcting for transactions bias in any of the regularly updated mainstream house price indices. This paper suggests a possible alternative approach, using information at postcode sector level and Fractional Probit Regression to correct for transactions bias in hedonic price indices based on one and a half million house sales from 1996 to 2004, distributed across 1200 postcode sectors in the South East of England.},

Although interest in evaluating the efficacy of tax and incentive programs is growing, data limitations are formidable: Tax policies and expenditures are difficult to track and administrators are not equipped to gather the data needed for rigorous evaluation. The PDIT covers 45 industries in 32 U.S. states, including the main cities in the 30 largest metropolitan areas. The PDIT simulates the value of an incentive in terms of value added of a hypothetical firm in a particular industry, state, and year from 1990 to 2015. The authors identify and exploit large, discrete changes in incentive policies (e.g., regime changes). Applying the difference-in-differences method, they investigate potential causal links between regime changes and medium-run economic outcomes, including employment, establishment counts, wages, and poverty rates.},
